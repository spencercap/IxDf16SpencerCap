*OSC* Open Sound Control
- UDP (super low security, very hackable)
- TCP (more secure, for sending data over network, like networked spaces, but then again who cares about security )
* both work on ports of IP

all routes begin with "/"









*MAX MSP*
• ability to make custom UI with JSUI object
    can use inlet and JS Math. functions
    can script in P5.js and talk to Max
